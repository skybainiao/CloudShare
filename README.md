# CloudShare

This is a photo sharing app
This idea comes from the chat software in the mobile phone,
usually we often send some funny emoji when we chat, 
so I want to create a platform for sharing pictures


Requirement:
1. As a user, I want to register an account to log into the application
2. As a user I would like to log in to use this application
3. As a registered user, I would like to log in to store my personal picture
4. As a registered user, I would like to log in to delete my picture
5. As a registered user, I would like to log in to create a folder to categorize pictures
6. As a registered user, I would like to log in to send friend requests to others
7. As a registered user, I would like to log in to share my pictures with others
8. As a registered user, I would like to log in to bookmark some pictures
9. As a registered user, I want to log in to modify my avatar
10. As a registered user, I would like to log in to comment on pictures when others share them
